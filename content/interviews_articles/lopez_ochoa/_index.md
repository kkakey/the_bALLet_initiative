### [Biography](http://www.annabellelopezochoa.com/www.annabellelopezochoa.com/Biography.html) 


"The Colombian-Belgian Annabelle Lopez Ochoa completed her dance education at the Royal Ballet School of Antwerp, Belgium. After a 12-year long career in various European dance companies Annabelle decides in 2003 to focus solely on choreography.

In that same year she was hailed *'rising star of the Dutch dance scene'* (NRC newspaper) and only 7 years later the Temecula Performing Arts Examiner wrote: *'Ochoa is truly a masterful choreographer with an edge for what dance can and should be in this constantly changing industry.'*

Annabelle is an award-winning and sought-after choreographer that has created works for 64 dance companies around the world." Continue reading her full bio [here.](http://www.annabellelopezochoa.com/www.annabellelopezochoa.com/Biography.html)

### <u>Interview Highlights</u>

I think in the classical dance world there is a lack [of female choreographers] and that's really due to the education and the education has to change… I think as women we feel that we have to stand in line and fit, otherwise we can be expelled or otherwise we don't make the cut.

You have to realize that female choreographers did not have as much opportunity [compared to their male counterparts] and so the craft—because it is a craft, the more you do it the better you get at it—the craft hasn't been developed because there was not that many opportunities as young choreographers when they just started.

I think there should be more female choreographers doing narrative work and be given a platform for it, because I think that the stories have to be retold through the eyes of a woman. I mean, basically the women characters have been set by men. And so they have a certain view of women that we don't have.
