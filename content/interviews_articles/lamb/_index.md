### <u>Interview Highlights</u>

**What has your experience been like as a choreographer, in general, and more specifically as a female choreographer?**


*I started choreography when I was very little as a child, but then when I got more into rigorous ballet training, performance, and being in a ballet company, I just let that all go and felt like I had to focus entirely on moving ahead with my ballet career. I always knew in the back of my head it was something that I wanted to return to, but I didn't dare to for quite a long time. Eventually I just felt like it was now or never. I started creating small works for choreographic workshops in the company I was dancing in Montreal, and it just grew very, very gradually from there. There was no big explosive breaking into the scene or anything. It's really been a very gradual evolution of bigger projects, more,  more visible projects.* 



**Ballet**

*I was a ballet dancer and I consider my work to be ballet--even though your die-hard classical people would probably not see that and simply because most of it isn't in pointe shoes. In fact, none of it has been in pointe shoes until the last couple of months I decided, okay, finally I'm going to see what I can do with this. I have really stayed away from it purposefully for a very long time because it's very constraining and it puts this whole different set of constraints on women than on men. I didn't like that aspect of it. Also when you're not wearing pointe shoes partnering tasks can be much more shared. And when you are wearing pointe shoes, you suddenly have one person who's way more less grounded, less stable, more dependent, more vulnerable, and so I didn't like the position that put women in and I also didn't like the position it put men in. And so I had started slowly to see if I could find a way of choreographing en pointe that feels like mine.*

*I just premiered a work as a ABT Choreographic Incubator yesterday, and that was the first thing I had shown publicly en pointe--and really it was only the first two minutes that were en pointe because it didn't feel equal to try to do a whole piece en pointe; I'm much slower creating en pointe than in socks. Nonetheless, even the choreography in socks, I still do consider to be ballet because I have these balletic values that are really imprinted and are from my earliest days. Line and specificity and form and flow, and ways that feel more balletic to me than a lot of the work that goes on in the contemporary world, and yet I'm also very influenced by contemporary choreographers.*

**Have you experienced hardships in the ballet realm in getting opportunities to have your pieces performed?**

*I wouldn't say that, in fact, I think I have benefited in a certain way from this in the last five or six years, sudden interest in the lack of female ballet choreographers. Suddenly ballet companies are scrambling to figure out who they can bring. Probably if somebody with a different resume were making the same work that I'm making, they would be more hesitant to bring me. But having ballet credentials seems to help a lot with the trust factor.*

*I would say that I have benefited from [the interest in the lack of female ballet choreographers], but also there is a bit of a glass ceiling that has to do with not making work en pointe. When it comes right down to–'okay, we're going to do a big name stage production and really put money into it,' and not just 'here's your $200 costume budget, see what you can find in the closet'–when it comes down to what they're really going to invest bigger money in, they want it to be more traditional and en pointe.*





**During your career, what changes if any have you noticed in the support for or number of female choreographers in ballet?**

*There is of course, this current interest right now and I think a lot of that has to do with the political situation and not wanting to appear biased or behind the time. I'm not sure whether ballet companies are ready for ballet to change. I think they would like women to come in and start making the kinds of ballets that men had been making. And that's not what I would prefer to see happening. I would prefer to see, both the political situation and the work evolve. So I think that's what they've been looking for like, 'okay, who can we bring that will make a kind of work that we think appeals to our audiences but also has two X chromosomes. ' That is probably also changing, so I think there's further to go in that regard then there is in just the statistical regard.*

*I think that there could also be sort of more thought about venues and what kind of venues would people like to see ballet. I think a lot of audiences would love to see really high-level ballet dancers in smaller theaters-- like a, six to 800 seat theater as opposed to 1500 to 2000 seat Opera house where you're seated a football field away and we can not really make out small details. I think there could also be more thought given to a range of venues for which different kinds of work could become appropriate.*

*Your perception of a work can totally miss out on everything--every important aspect of some pieces--if you're seated far away.*

**When you were just starting to choreograph, what do you wish you had known or what support do you wish you had had when starting your career?**

*Yeah, of course. I would have liked to have had more support from the company that I was dancing with at the time because that didn't really happen, for a variety of reasons. One of those reasons was that there wasn't a range of venues.* 

*You have to build a choreographer. It's not like, 'somebody did a good workshop piece, let's commission a main stage work.' Although that does happen sometimes, but it's a disservice to the choreographer because it takes 10 or more years to build the dancer and get the 10,000 hours of mastery, it takes the same time to really build a choreographer who is going to be solid and confident in that main stage situation, and most ballet companies are not set up to have a ladder of opportunities. You have the choreographic workshop, low budget, or no budget in a small space, then there's the main stage productions, and there's not anything in between. They don't want to take a risk on an inexperienced person for a big production.*

*I wish I'd had more support, but I also, even beyond that, I guess I wish that I had known that I didn't have to know everything before I started making a piece. I didn't have to have the whole thing diagrammed out. And I never do. But somehow I had in my head that I can't choreograph until I know everything.*

**From your own experiences as both a dancer and choreographer, what do you think would help solve this problem?**

*I think it's not something that happens overnight. I think with new generations of choreographers and new generations dancers, it helps to have role models. I don't think I would've been able to go into this if I didn't have the role model of Crystal Pite who works both in the ballet in the contemporary world. I think a big concern of mine coming into it was that all the choreographers I had worked with, almost exclusively men, were fairly disliked among the dancers. It was an unpleasant working environment, sort of authoritative or it was not a relationship that I often felt good about. So I just was like, I know I'm interested in choreography, but I cannot imagine being that person all the time. I can't withstand that, being hated.*

*And so to have this example of a woman choreographer who was very soft spoken but extremely respected. I have not had the chance to dance for her but everyone who I know who had danced for her--in large or small roles, groups or principal roles--seems to say the same thing: she treats everyone really well and that the atmosphere is respectful, and they feel good about the relationship. So I think if I had not had that example in front of me that it would've been hard to pursue this.*
