This is a calendar of upcoming ballet performances in New York City featuring female choreographed pieces. 

Have or know of a performance not listed here that features the work of female choreographers? Please email <the.ballet.initiative@gmail.com> to have it included.

Note: We are currently in the process of adding shows to this calendar, so if it seems "empty," that is why!
