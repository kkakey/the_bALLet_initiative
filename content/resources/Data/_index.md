In the 2018-2019 season, 81% of pieces produced by ballet companies in America were choreographed by men, while only approximately 17% were created by women. Among companies doing the “best” in terms of featuring the most female choreographed works, only three out of the fifty largest companies’ repertoire were majority female choreographed. These statistics, and the data used in this project here, are all from [Dance Data Project’s 2018-2019 Season Overview report](www.google.com).

In this plot, explore how many of the country’s major ballet companies have done these past two seasons in terms of showcasing works by women. Hover over a data point to learn more about a specific company, search for a company you are interested in, select companies to compare and contrast their progress, and sort them by year to see how they rank.
