long_text: "While ballet schools and companies are comprised overwhelmingly of girls compared to boys, 
women in artistic and executive leadership positions in ballet are few and far in between. Among 15 of the 
largest companies—defined as those with the greatest operating budgets—only Miami City Ballet and Washington 
Ballet have a female artistic director. Not only do major ballet companies lack representation in artistic 
leadership, but the gender diversity of choreographic works also continues to suffer. In the 2018-2019 season, 
81% of pieces produced were choreographed by men, while only approximately 17% were created by women; among 
companies doing the “best” in terms of featuring the most 
women choreographed works, only three out of the fifty largest companies’ repertoire were majority women 
choreographed, according to Dance Data Project.<br><br> 

Despite the large number of women in ballet, there is a dearth of women artistic directors and choreographers.<br><br>

In order to ensure the voices of women are heard—both within and outside of ballet—we need more women 
choreographers to be supported and their works to be performed. The divide in creativity restricts 
the voices and representation of women and minorities; for ballet to reach its fullest potential and for 
audiences to experience a range of perspectives, there is a dire need for change.<br><br>

*the bALLet initiative* is a platform that promotes the work of women choreographers and strives to draw greater 
attention to the gender disparity in choreography and leadership in the world of ballet. By connecting individuals 
to the problem and actions they can take to support female choreographers, you can take part in the movement to 
change ballet."
